\section{Air speed estimation}
Before it is possible to conclude whether the the skirts around the Flatiron building will billow, we first need to know what wind speed is needed to overcome gravity.

\section{Dimensions of the obstacles}
\label{appendixdimensions}
As discussed in \autoref{obstacles}, the obstacles used in the CFD analysis were estimated using Google Maps. In \autoref{maps} it is shown how these distances were estimated.

\label{maps}
\end{figure}
From this figure and the measurement tool on the Google Maps program, we found the following dimensions for the Flatiron building and surroundings. The numbers correspond with the building blocks in \autoref{measurements}. Block number 1 and 3 contain 2 buildings, both exactly the same size and 25 meters apart.

\begin{tabular}{  r  r  r }
\hline
Building block No. & x-length & y-length\\
\hline 
1 & 20 & 60\\
2 & 30 & 60 \\
3 & 20 & 60\\
Space between & 25 & 25 \\
