\begin{abstract}
In this report the behavior of wind is simulated around the Flatiron building in Manhattan, New York, in order to find our if the folklore of skirts blowing up by the wind is true. Using an in-house built CFD program that solves using RANS, it was found that partly due to the geometry of the building, a patch of high pressure was formed behind the building, causing wind to be unpredictable and even creating an updraft. This result complies with the urban myth.
