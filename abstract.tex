In this report the behaviour of bubbles in micro-channels splitting into 2 branches at a Y-junction is analyzed. After a short distance $L_{branch}$ a reservoir connecting both branches is placed to negate memory in the system. This system displays several flow patterns: both periodic and irregular. The found behaviour depends on the bubble speed, $v_{bubble}$, and the length between the bubbles, $L_{slug}$. By increasing the gas and liquid flow rate, greater $v_{bubble}$ and $L_{slug}$ were achieved resulting in stable distribution patterns. Perfectly alternating behaviour was exhibited when $L_{slug} = 0.64L_{branch}$, which means that only bubble is in one of the branches at all times. This result complies with the theory that the reservoir enables perfectly alternating distributions.
